    <h1>Border Collie</h1>
    <p>
        My favorite dog breed is the Border Collie, this is because they are the most intelligent 
        dog breed and loyal.

    <h2>Poodle</h2>
    <p>
        My favorite second breed is the Poodle. This is because they come in a varity of colors 
        and 3 differnt sizes. They rank 2-3 in intelligence and are fun to try diffent coats cuts.
