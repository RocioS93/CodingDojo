Intro Notes
3 programming languages to make a basic website: HTML, CSS, and Javascript
    We are going over HTML and tags (another word for tags are elements)
    the core of an html file is the doctype tag, html tag, head tag, body tag
    to view an HTML file, you need a browser to see what it creates. 
     To see the literal file with it's tags, you will need to use a text
      editor like notepad or VSCode
    the body holds most if not all elements
tags have a start and end. for example the <h> tag. to start, 
use <h#1-6> and end </h#1-6> with a forward slash
p tag stands for paragraph. it is usually for normal text
!the computer reads the html tags from top to bottom on a  html file!
 If writing alot of cone inset text between tags with space before and after
  <p>
