    <p>
        Poodles come in three size varieties: 
        <ul>
           <li>Standards should be more than 15 inches tall at the shoulder</li>
           <li>Miniatures are 15 inches or under</li>
           <li>Toys stand no more than 10 inches</li>
        </ul>
        All three varieties have the same build and proportions. 
        At dog shows, Poodles are usually seen in the elaborate Continental Clip. 
        Most pet owners prefer the simpler Sporting Clip, in which the 
        coat is shorn to follow the outline of the squarely built, smoothly muscled body.
