    <h2>
        Singapuras are native in their homeland, Singapore. There are no records or background to 
        show that any cross-breeding took place. The name “Singapura” is Singapore in Malaysian, 
        and these cats were believed to have been around for more than 300 years, descended from cats 
        who came in Singapore and bred with the local cats.
    </h2>
    <p>
        The Singapura is the smallest breed of domestic cat which is known for its large eyes
         and ears and close-lying ticked fur. They are said to have originated from drain cats 
         in Singapore although their history is shrouded with controversy. Singapuras are enchanting 
         and everybody who one is won over by their inquisitive, laid-back and friendly personality 
         who is easy to care for and will remain playful well into adulthood.
