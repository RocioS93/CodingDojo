Div not only div section of html, for organixation, it also groups tags for css
can use class atribute for "almost" every tag

<!--HTML Comment-->
/*CSS Comment*/


Classes start with a .
Classes are reusable, its best practice to use logical names
!!!!Clases take piority over tag modifications!!!!
Can add more than one class on a tag
Ad them next to each other with a space inbetween the Quotaion marks EX. "textred bigtext"



!!!!!!!BOTH HTML AND CSS ARE READ TOP TO BOTTOM!!!!!!!!


id's are just like classes, but you can't reuse them and have a highter priority than anything else

!!!!!!Priority Level!!!!!!
1. ID
2. Class
3. Tag

Id's usually named specificly for a tag 
<tag (id)>
stars with #name in Css
!!!!!!!!CAN ONLY HAVE ONE ID PER TAG!!!!!!!!!
